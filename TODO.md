# Tools with instant prompt and codeblock input

I need a streaming API that goes from prompt to hosted files. Together with a simple fetch api this is a killer coding agent that allows for making a more scalable website.

ü§î The `content/set` tool is great, but if we would use it as an agent, it would not make the code visible, or it would need to generate the code twice. Rather than that, we can move the code for this tool to the backend by asking the agent to execute after the end of the codeblock. However, it should be given previousCodeblock automatically.

In `/chat/completion`, allow setting a `codeblockOperationId` and `promptOperationId` which contain operationId of the openapi that should recieve `code+language` and `prompt` automatically. This should remove these toplevel params from the context of the tool, and attach them automatically.

Now, instruct an agent to call after generating code. The resulting links shall now appear as part of the text generation, making it much more performant, and elegant üí™üî•

Now we can simplify and generalise the chat frontend, because the info is in the markdown, which can be rendered as required.

This further brings the ability to use code generation tools anywhere.

# Tools for Navigation

ü§î Threads get stored independently of openapiUrl, only in localStorage. OpenapiUrl can be re-routed without trouble, making it dynamic while keeping thread as-is. The url determines the openapi, the openapi determines the tools and authorization. I have already added operationIds, but another very interesting thing would be to embed actionschema search into big openapis, so we only show the most relevant tool(s) based on the messages.

For this, maybe we can also create a new property `redirectOperationId`. If the redirect operation has a property `location:string` (and maybe `target:"_blank"`) in the response, the browser should navigate there.

ü§î Don't know yet how to make it navigatable to other agents. Maybe that should be specifyable in a specific format.

‚úÖ If we want agents to automatically pick up `redirectOperationId`, `codeblockOperationId` and `promptOperationId`, we could add these into the operation item. Added to the spec!

‚ùóÔ∏è I really want to see a router agent... That would be my new starting point!
